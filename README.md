## Description

This implements a genetic programming approach to solve the PF Max problem devised by Massey et al (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-24855-2_66) through the creation of Push style programs. Push programs consist of quantum gates and control structure elements so that they create resultant quantum programs which can be evaluted as solutions.
